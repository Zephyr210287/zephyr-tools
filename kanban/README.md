# Minimal Kanban Board

A simple, self-contained kanban board in a single HTML file. No dependencies, no build step, no backend.

## Features

- 4 columns: Backlog, To Do, Blocked, Done
- Drag and drop cards between columns
- Drag to reorder priority within columns
- Mobile touch support
- Cards with title, description, and context fields
- Data persisted in localStorage
- Dark theme

## Usage

Just open `index.html` in a browser, or serve it:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## Why?

Sometimes you just want a kanban board without signing up for anything, without a database, without complexity. This is that.

## License

MIT - do whatever you want with it.
